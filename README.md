The aim of this project is to design and simulate a control system for an automated car parking system  using a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The project will provide hands-on experience with real world applications of PLCs and reinforce key concepts learned throughout the course.  

NOTE!!!!!!
If your TIA Portal is cracked, The "Smart_parking_PLC_Code.zip" file is most likely causing your application to stop working and you may encounter a licensing issue
The version required to open this project is at least V16
The HMI is not complete yet; it still needs some modifications, but the entire system logic is working well.
